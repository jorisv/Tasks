Tasks is library for real time control of robots and kinematic trees using constrained optimization.
It has been used extensively to control humanoid robots such as HOAP-3, HRP-2, HRP-4 and Atlas.

Documentation
-------------

Features:
 * Support Kinematics Tree with Revolute/Prismatic/Spherical/Free/Planar/Cylindrical joints
 * Dynamic motion (motion must fulfill the equation of motion)
 * Contact forces in friction cones
 * Static contacts
 * Articular position, speed and torque limits
 * Collision avoidance
 * Multi-robot contact (can solve problems involving multiple robots in contact)
 * Tasks:
  * Posture target (articular position target, mandatory if you want avoid singularity issues)
  * Link Position/Orientation target
  * Link Velocity target
  * Center of Mass (CoM) target
  * Momentum target
  * Contact force target

To make sure that Tasks works as intended, unit tests are available for each algorithm.

The [SpaceVecAlg and RBDyn tutorial](https://github.com/jorisv/sva_rbdyn_tutorials) is also a big resources to understand how to use Tasks by providing a lot of IPython Notebook that will present real use case.

An online documentation can be found [online](https://jrl-umi3218.github.io/Tasks).

```

## Manually build from source

### Dependencies

To compile you need the following tools and libraries:

 * [Git]()
 * [CMake]() >= 2.8
 * [pkg-config]()
 * [doxygen]()
 * [g++]() >= 4.7Â (for C++11 support)
 * [Boost](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html) >= 1.49
 * [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) >= 3.2
 * [SpaceVecAlg](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/SpaceVecAlg)
 * [RBDyn](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/RBDyn)
 * [eigen-qld](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/eigen-qld)
 * [eigen-lssol]() (Optional, if you have the LSSOL licence ask us this library)
 * [sch-core](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/sch-core)

For Python bindings:
 * [Cython](http://cython.org/) >= 0.2
 * [Eigen3ToPython](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/Eigen3ToPython)
 * [sch-core-python](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/sch-core-python)

### Building

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/Tasks
cd Tasks
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake [options] ..
make && make intall
```

#### CMake options

By default, the build will use the `python` and `pip` command to install the bindings for the default system version (this behaviour can be used to build the bindings in a given virtualenv). The following options allow to control this behaviour:

 * `PYTHON_BINDING` Build the python binding (ON/OFF, default: ON)
 * `PYTHON_BINDING_FORCE_PYTHON2`: use `python2` and `pip2` instead of `python` and `pip`
 * `PYTHON_BINDING_FORCE_PYTHON3`: use `python3` and `pip3` instead of `python` and `pip`
 * `PYTHON_BINDING_BUILD_PYTHON2_AND_PYTHON3`: builds two sets of bindings one with `python2` and `pip2`, the other with `python3` and `pip3`
 * `DISABLE_TESTS` Disable unit tests building (ON/OFF, default: OFF)
